## Human Activity Recognition Data
Our smartphones contain sensors that can track your physical location, speed, and orientation (position relative to vertical). Many of us enjoy using apps that monitor our activities. Researchers and app creators use the data streams to detect and classify different types of physical activity; hence, "human activity recognition". 

This repository contains data and documentation for BUS212 assignments using data downloaded from 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heterogeneity+Activity+Recognition+Data+Set or the personal Website: http://cs.au.dk/~allans/heterogenity/.

The data were generated and published by Allan Stisen, Henrik Blunck, Sourav Bhattacharya, Thor Siiger Prentow, Mikkel Baun Kjærgaard, Anind Dey, Tobias Sonne, and Mads Møller Jensen "Smart Devices are Different: Assessing and Mitigating Mobile Sensing Heterogeneities for Activity Recognition" In Proc. 13th ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems (SenSys 2015), Seoul, Korea, 2015. http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2809695.2809718

The authors were investigating the precision of two "motion sensors commonly found in smartphones" and watches-- accelerometers and gyroscopes. Although these kinds of sensors are becoming standard features of mobile devices, they vary considerably in their accuracy.
The accelerometers and gyroscopes record and transmit data at regular intervals. Researchers and app creators use the data streams to detect and classify different types of physical activity; hence, "human activity recognition".
